# Expense Tracker

This is a simple Expense Tracker application built using AWS Lambda, PostgreSQL, JWT authentication, and a frontend interface for managing user registration, login, and tracking expenses. The backend leverages AWS services like Lambda, RDS (for PostgreSQL), and API Gateway. 

## Features

- **User Registration**: Register a new user with email and password.
- **User Login**: Login using email and password, receiving a JWT token for authentication.
- **Add Transaction**: Users can add new expense transactions with details such as amount, category, etc.
- **Get Expense Summary**: Retrieve the total expense summary grouped by categories for an authenticated user.
- **Delete Transaction**: Delete a specific transaction from the database.

## Setup

### Backend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have `python3` and `pip` installed. Then install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Database Configuration**
   - Create an RDS PostgreSQL database and configure the connection credentials.
   - Set up the environment variables like `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `SECRET_KEY` in your `config.json`.

3. **Serverless Deployment**
   If you're using AWS Lambda and API Gateway for deployment, install the [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/):

   ```bash
   npm install -g serverless
   ```

   Then deploy the functions:

   ```bash
   cd backend/deploy
   serverless deploy
   ```

   This will deploy the Lambda functions and the RDS instance as defined in `serverless.yml`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **HTML & JavaScript**: The frontend is a simple web interface with HTML forms to allow users to register, log in, and manage their expenses.
   - **index.html**: The main page for user registration and login.
   - **app.js**: Handles communication with the backend API for user registration, login, and fetching data.
   - **style.css**: Basic styling for the frontend.

2. **Integrating Frontend with Backend**: Ensure the correct API URL is set in `app.js`. Replace the placeholder with the actual API Gateway URL.

   ```javascript
   const apiUrl = "https://your-api-url.amazonaws.com";
   ```

3. **Run Locally (Optional)**: For local testing, you can use simple HTTP servers (like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)) to serve the static files.

## Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:

1. **POST /register**: Register a new user.
   - Request body: `{ "email": "user@example.com", "password": "password" }`
   - Response: `{ "message": "User registered successfully" }`

2. **POST /login**: Login to an existing account and receive a JWT token.
   - Request body: `{ "email": "user@example.com", "password": "password" }`
   - Response: `{ "token": "JWT_TOKEN" }`

3. **POST /add-transaction**: Add a new expense transaction.
   - Headers: `{ "Authorization": "Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" }`
   - Request body: `{ "transaction_id": "123", "amount": 100, "category": "Food" }`
   - Response: `{ "message": "Transaction added successfully" }`

4. **GET /get-expense-summary**: Get a summary of expenses grouped by category.
   - Headers: `{ "Authorization": "Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" }`
   - Response: `{ "expenses": { "Food": 200, "Transport": 50 } }`

5. **DELETE /delete-transaction**: Delete a specific transaction.
   - Headers: `{ "Authorization": "Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>" }`
   - Request body: `{ "transaction_id": "123" }`
   - Response: `{ "message": "Transaction deleted successfully" }`

## Notes

- **JWT Authentication**: All sensitive endpoints (such as `add-transaction`, `get-expense-summary`, and `delete-transaction`) require a valid JWT token, which is returned on successful login.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: All user data and transactions are stored in a PostgreSQL database running on AWS RDS. Ensure the database is correctly configured in the `config.json`.
- **Security**: In production, never expose your `SECRET_KEY` or database credentials. Use environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager to securely manage sensitive information.

## Conclusion

This Expense Tracker app allows users to manage their expenses with ease. You can register, log in, add transactions, view expense summaries, and delete transactions. The backend is serverless, powered by AWS Lambda, and the frontend is simple yet functional.
